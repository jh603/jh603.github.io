  I am a PhD student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) advised by
  <a href="https://tongzhang-ml.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Tong Zhang</a> 
  and 
  <a href="https://hmr-lab.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Julia Hockenmaier</a>.

  <p>
  My research focuses on developing generative models that are not only more intelligent but also reliable. Specifc topics I am currently pursuing include continual learning, curriculum learning, and the design of memory structures and agentic frameworks.
